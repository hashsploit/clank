![Clank Logo](clank-logo.png)

Clank is a high-performance and Open Source implementation of the
proprietary SCE-RT Medius server stack used in many PlayStation 2
and PlayStation 3 multiplayer titles. The project was originally
intended for *Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal* for the
[UYA Online](https://uyaonline.com/) project. However we decided
to redesign it to work with many other Medius titles as well.

Our server aims to be feature rich, modular, stable, and **fast**.

Currently this server supports emulating Medius v1.5 - v1.8, however we plan on
adding support for Medius v1.9 and v1.10 (2.10) soon.

## Supported Games
The table below shows game titles that have been tested with Clank.
The focus of the table below is based on a title's ability to get from login to getting in a game world.
- **SUCCESS** = Able to get past MAS into MLS, create a game world on DME(P2S2P) or MAS(P2P) and be active in the game world.
- **PARTIAL** = Able to get past MAS into MLS.
- **INCOMPLETE** = Missing components or planned features to get past MAS.
- **UNKNOWN** = The title cannot be tested at the moment. See the description column for more info.

## Building and Running Clank

### Latest builds
If you use Docker you can pull the latest release of Clank on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashsploit/clank), see [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for more info on how to use the Clank docker image.

Otherwise you can download the [latest jar here](https://ci.arcadiamc.cz/job/clank/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/clank.jar).
Thanks to [Speedy11CZ](https://github.com/speedy11cz) for the automated CI build server.


### Build Clank
You can build clank by using the Clank Dev Script Tool (clank for Mac/Linux, or clank.bat for Windows).

**Note:** Any changes to the `src/main/proto/` files will require the protocol buffers
to be recompiled. This can easily be run by running `./clank proto` on Linux
or `clank.bat proto` on Windows. Running either `./clank build` or `clank.bat build` automatically
invokes the protobuf to be recompiled too.

#### Building Clank on Mac/Linux
1. Run `./clank build`.

#### Building Clank on Windows
1. Run `clank.bat build`.

#### Building Clank in Docker
1. See [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for more info.

### Run Clank
In order to run Clank you will need to create a JSON configuration file, there are
example configuration files located in `config/`, that can be used as a starting
place. For example, make a copy of `config/mas.json.example` named `config/mas.json`.

You can then use `./launch.sh config/mas.json` on Linux, or `build.bat config\mas.json`, to run a Clank MAS server.

#### Running Clank on Mac/Linux
1. Copy the example configuration file `config/mas.json.example` -> `config/mas.json`.
2. Run `./clank run config/mas.json`.

#### Running Clank on Windows
1. Copy the example configuration file `config\mas.json.example` -> `config\mas.json`.
2. Run `clank.bat run config\mas.json`.

#### Running Clank in Docker
1. See [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for more info.



## Configuration

![Clank Diagram](clank-diagram.png)

You can read more about the PS2 Medius components [here](https://wiki.hashsploit.net/PlayStation_2#Medius),
or you can read about the PS3 Medius components [here](https://wiki.hashsploit.net/PlayStation_3#Medius).

See [config/README.md](config/README.md) for more info on the configuration files.



## Console commands
Each emulation mode of Clank has different built-in commands as
they differ per context and implementation, however you can
always use the `help` command to view all commands available in
the current component being run. Some commands have
`[optional]` and or `<required>` parameters.

For *all* emulation modes:
- `exit` - Shutdown the server emulator.
- `help [command]` - Show all commands, or show information about a specific command.
- `version` - Show the current version of the server emulator.

For *MAS*, *MLS* and *MUIS* emulation modes:
- `broadcast <severity> <message>` - Broadcast a message to all the players connected.


## Lua plugin API
You can read more about the Clank Lua plugin API in the [clank-plugins](https://github.com/hashsploit/clank-plugins) repo.


## About the SCE-RT / RTIME / Medius Protocol
SCE-RT is the underlying protocol of Medius titles for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3.
SCE-RT was developed by the acquisition of RTIME Inc. by Sony Computer Entertainment
America for their underlying game networking engine for PlayStation 2 games.

RTIME (1997):
